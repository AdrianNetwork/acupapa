# Adrian Abascal - Connect Over Coffee

Welcome to my GitHub repository and website, where we can "Connect Over Coffee." This is the virtual coffee shop where we can come together, have meaningful conversations, and explore exciting opportunities. We might actually be able to meet over coffee and create something new!

## About Me

I'm Adrian Abascal (with a bunch of letters after my name), and I'm delighted to connect with you. Here's a glimpse into my background and interests:

- **Professional Journey:** I've embarked on a diverse professional journey, including specializations in medicine, authorship of insightful books, active participation in entrepreneurship, and ambitious plans for the future.

- **Medicine:** My passion lies in medicine and well-being, where I help individuals, specifically children, find balance and vitality through acupuncture and alternative therapies. Children don't usually get a choice in thier bodies and health, what if they did?

- **Authorship:** I've authored two impactful books:
  - "The Rapid Recovery Resource" - Empowering parents, coaches, and athletes to overcome injuries and soreness.
  - "Finding the Perfect Daycare" - Guiding families through the daycare selection process.

- **Entrepreneurship:** I'm a co-founder and serve on the administrative side of Green Village Daycare, a community of family-centric daycares and micro schools united by shared values. I run the business end of it. Additionally, I'm excited to be part of an innovative cold-plunge start-up, redefining wellness.

- **Future Aspirations:** My vision includes opening a holistic pediatric office, addressing children's medical needs without resorting to drugs or surgery.

## Let's Connect

This is more than just a website; it's an opportunity to connect and collaborate. Here's how we can get started:
